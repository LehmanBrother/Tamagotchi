# Tamagotchi

The purpose of this project was to create a "Tamagotchi" game in which the player would be responsible for the well-being of a pet, using an array of buttons to keep its hunger, sleepiness, and boredom in check. As the game progresses, the pet will evolve into new forms and spawn a new pet (that, for the sake of simplicity, will not require any maintenance). The player will be notified of salient events via an alert at the top of the screen, and a variety of audio easter eggs can be accessed through various unspecified user actions.
